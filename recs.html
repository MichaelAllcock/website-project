                <li>Dishoom - London, UK</li>
                <p>
                    When you go to London, it is not all about meat pies and fish & chips. London has some of the best Indian food
                    in the world. One of my favorite place's is Dishoom. They have a great atmosphere with an intimate bar
                    and seating arrangement. When it comes to the food, it is fantastic! You will want to have seconds.
